Assignment #1: Content extraction and search using Apache Tika - Extra Credit

The code contains only one JAVA file named TikaHW.java

Copy the vault folder and tika-app-1.4.jar to my folder. Change the directory to my folder where all the files are stored and run the following commands. I am using another jar named commons-lang3-3.3.1.jar which is already available in my folder. Please note I have used version 1.4 of tika app jar.

To compile the code: (For windows put ';' instead of ':')
javac -classpath .:tika-app-1.4.jar:commons-lang3-3.3.1.jar TikaHW.java

To execute the code: (For windows put ';' instead of ':')
java -classpath .:tika-app-1.4.jar:commons-lang3-3.3.1.jar TikaHW

I have included the output.txt and log.txt files in the folder as well. They have the output of the code when I ran it on my machine. They will get replaced when the code is run from the same folder again.
