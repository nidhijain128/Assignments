I have included all my code in one file named Assn1.java. Also, I have added social-network.txt file in the same folder as the .java file.

Steps to compile and execute the code:
1.	Kindly change the directory to my folder named Nidhi_Jain_HW1
2. 	To compile the code, in cmd type javac Assn1.java
		Four .class files will get generated namely Assn1.class, Edge.class, Graph.class, Node.class
3.	To execute the code, in cmd type java -cp . Assn1
		3 output files will get generated in the same folder as the .java file namely breadth-first.result.txt, 		depth-first.result.txt and uniform-cost.result.txt


For any compilation or execution issues, please contact me on +12179745588.
Thank you.
