I have included all my code in two files named ClassConnect4.java and BoardConnect4.java. Also, I have added hw2input.txt file in the same folder as the .java file.

First move prints the value of Alice's first move that maximizes the heuristic value.

Steps to compile and execute the code on Aludra:
1.	Kindly change the directory to my folder named Nidhi_Jain_HW2
2. 	To compile the code, in cmd type /usr/usc/jdk/1.6.0_23/bin/javac BoardConnect4.java ClassConnect4.java
		2 class files will get generated namely ClassConnect4.class and BoardConnect4.class
3.	To execute the code, in cmd type /usr/usc/jdk/1.6.0_23/bin/java -cp . ClassConnect4 hw2input.txt hw2output.txt
		1 output file will get generated in the same folder as the .java file namely hw2output.txt

Steps to compile and execute the code on local machine:
1.	To compile the code, in cmd type javac BoardConnect4.java ClassConnect4.java 
		2 class files will get generated namely ClassConnect4.class and BoardConnect4.class
2.	To execute the code, in cmd type java -cp . ClassConnect4 hw2input.txt hw2output.txt
		1 output file will get generated in the same folder as the .java file namely hw2output.txt

Please Note: JDK 1.6 or higher needed to execute the code.
