I have included all my code in 4 files named LogicSAT.java, LogicSATPLResolution.java, Clause.java and SubClause.java. Also, I have added input.txt and output.txt file in the same folder as the .java file.

Steps to compile and execute the code on Aludra:
1.	Kindly change the directory to my folder named Nidhi_Jain_HW2
2. 	To compile the code, in cmd type /usr/usc/jdk/1.6.0_23/bin/javac LogicSAT.java LogicSATPLResolution.java Clause.java SubClause.java
		4 class files will get generated.
3.	To execute the code, in cmd type /usr/usc/jdk/1.6.0_23/bin/java LogicSAT input.txt output.txt
		1 output file will get generated in the same folder as the .java file namely output.txt

Steps to compile and execute the code on local machine:
1.	To compile the code, in cmd type javac LogicSAT.java LogicSATPLResolution.java Clause.java SubClause.java 
		4 class files will get generated.
2.	To execute the code, in cmd type java LogicSAT input.txt output.txt
		1 output file will get generated in the same folder as the .java file namely output.txt

Please Note: JDK 1.6 or higher needed to execute the code.
